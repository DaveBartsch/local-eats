      <h2> The benefits of eating local foods </h2>
      <p>
        Are you a locavore? Locavores are people who try to choose locally grown
        or locally produced food that is in season. There are many definitions
        of "local food", but the concept is based primarily on distance. Many
        people like to purchase food locally by starting within their own
        community, then moving out to the region, province, country and so on.
        This type of food consumption is the basis for the popular 100-mile
        diet, which promotes buying and eating food that's grown, manufactured
        or produced within a 100-mile radius of the consumer’s home.

      <h2> Why eat "local"?</h2>
      <p>
        These are just a few of the numerous potential benefits of eating local:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          It’s good for the environment. Local food doesn’t have to travel as
          far to arrive on your plate, so it helps reduce greenhouse gas
          emissions and contributes to improving our carbon footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          It benefits the local economy, including supporting local farmers and
          other producers.
        </li>
        <li>
          It encourages sustainable agriculture, and facilitates tracking the
          supply chain back to the point of origin to evaluate ecological
          practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          It ensures that food has passed some of the highest safety standards
          in the world. Very strict regulations regarding additives, pesticides,
          herbicides, etc. ensure that Canadian food is safe.
        </li>
        <li>
          It may have a higher nutrient value, as food that is grown and
          harvested locally is usually given more time to ripen. This does not,
          however, automatically mean that local food is necessarily more
          nutritious, as other factors come into play.
        </li>
        <li>
          We might be biased, but we think eating local just tastes better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>Are local foods more nutritious?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several factors that influence the nutritive value of produce
        including crop variety, how it's grown, ripeness at harvest, storage,
        processing and packaging. Its vitamin and mineral content depends on the
        practices of people all along the line, from the seed to the table,
        whether or not produce is local or transported from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Produce such as broccoli, green beans, kale, red peppers, tomatoes,
        apricots and peaches are susceptible to nutrient loss when harvested and
        transported from longer distances, while those that are heartier such as
        apples, oranges, grapefruit and carrots keep their nutrients even if
        they travel long distances.
